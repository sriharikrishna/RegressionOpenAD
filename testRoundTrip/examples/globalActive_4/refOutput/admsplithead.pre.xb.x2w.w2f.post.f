C General Information:
C xaifBooster is intended for the transformation of 
C numerical programs represented as xml files according 
C to the XAIF schema. It is part of the OpenAD framework. 
C The main application is automatic 
C differentiation, i.e. the generation of code for 
C the computation of derivatives. 
C The following people are the principal authors of the 
C current version: 
C 	Uwe Naumann
C	Jean Utke
C Additional contributors are: 
C	Andrew Lyons
C	Peter Fine
